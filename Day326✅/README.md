# Day 326 - Phase 1: SQL Basics

## Overview

This project is designed to help beginners learn the basics of SQL. It covers the first phase of SQL learning, including creating tables, inserting data, retrieving and filtering records, sorting data, using basic aggregate functions, and pattern matching.

By completing this phase, you will be able to:

* Create tables and insert records
* Query data using `SELECT` and `WHERE`
* Sort data using `ORDER BY`
* Perform simple calculations using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
* Filter data using patterns and ranges (`LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`)
* Retrieve distinct values from a column (`DISTINCT`)

## Files

* **main.sql** – Contains all SQL commands and exercises for Phase 1.

---

## Requirements

* SQL environment (choose one):

  * [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/download.html) (lightweight, easy for beginners)
  * [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
  * [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  * Online playground: [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) or [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/)

---

## Instructions

1. Open your SQL environment or online SQL playground.
2. Copy the contents of `main.sql` into the SQL editor.
3. Run the SQL script to:

   * Create the `students` table
   * Insert sample data
   * Execute example queries and mini challenges
4. Review the output and try modifying the queries to explore SQL concepts further.

## Exercises

The SQL file contains mini exercises for practice:

1. Find all students with grade `A`.
2. Get the average age of students.
3. Retrieve students whose names start with `A`.
4. Find students whose name contains `h` and age ≥ 17.

Try changing the conditions, adding new records, and writing your own queries to reinforce your learning.
